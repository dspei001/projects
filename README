DESCRIPTION
-----------

This program generates a vertical histogram based on sample values generated using the 
method of sample distribution selected by the user. The user is then prompted for the 
appropriate values for mean, standard deviation, and number of bins. The result is the 
histogram, population mean, population standard deviation, values entered by the user, 
most-used bins, ranges for each bin, and the number of values that fell into each bin.

NOTE: All sample values are written to a text file for reference. See writeSamples().
NOTE: The Make option, 'make clean', will delete object files AND the sample text file(s).
