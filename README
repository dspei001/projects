DESCRIPTION
-----------

This page was a Hackathon project for Broward College in 2017. The idea was to create a 
site for an entity, Clear Funds, that would act as a sort of donation funds transparency 
system for participating non-profits or other charitable programs. The user is the donor 
who would be able to search for a participating organization and be presented with a list 
of services provided by that organization where the donor can then select and contribute to 
specific services of his or her choosing. This was intended to provide more transparency 
regarding the use of donation funds, discourage charity fraud, and provide a mechanism for 
people to find and make connections with vetted, trustworthy organizations, as well as 
report any suspected fraud.
