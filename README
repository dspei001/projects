DESCRIPTION
-----------

This program demonstrates memory allocation under the first fit, best fit, and worst fit 
algorithms. Displayed on the console is a lot of colored text to demonstrate each step of
process. If the size of memory is <= 1000, then the contents of memory are also printed at 
each step. At the very end of the simulation, the final average memory utilization (AMU), 
average number of holes examined by the chosen algorithm, total execution time in seconds, 
and a line that displays the variables that were used for the simulation are all displayed.

NOTE ON MAKEFILE: The included Makefile has several options for choosing the simulation
variables as well as 3 tests. Each 'test' or 'scene' operation also performs 'make clean' 
and 'make all' just before running the program. The variables per Make operation are listed
as follows where the numbers represent (number of iterations, memory size, mean, std dev):

test1: 10 100 25 7
test2: 100 200 104857 26214.0
test3: 10000 5000 419430 136314.8

scene1: 1000 16777216 1048576 262144.0
scene2: 1000 16777216 4194304 1363148.8
scene3: 500 1073741824 268435456 67108864.0
