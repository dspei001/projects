DESCRIPTION
-----------

This program takes two files as input where the first file is a list of order times and 
the second a list of delivery times. The output is a new file containing the elapsed times. 
Times in all files are formatted as: DD HH:mm:ss. Time Elapsed is the first project where I 
have made use of JavaSwing components to create a minimal GUI. 

NOTE: Much of this code still needs refactoring, thus it is still a work in progress.
